This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.10.

## Runing python parser
To run the parser we need to get the python 3 program to be able to read the information from the live site and parse it into a json format for the web application consumption.<br />

This python script needs the following packages :<br />
-bs4:<br />
pip3 install bs4<br />
-requests<br />
pip3 install requests<br />
-bottle<br />
pip3 install bottle<br />
-json<br />
pip3 install json<br />


To run the python script it needs to be a command from the terminal as so:<br />
python3 parser.py

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
