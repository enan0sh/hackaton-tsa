# HackatonTsa

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.10.

## Runing python parser
To run the parser we need to get the python 3 program to be able to read the information from the live site and parse it into a json format for the web application consumption.

This python script needs the following packages :
-bs4:
pip3 install bs4
-requests
pip3 install requests
-bottle
pip3 install bottle
-json
pip3 install json


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
